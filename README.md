# AVL Trees Part 1: Basics
## Motivation
* Background
  - The running time of BST is O(n) in the worst case and O(logn) in average with random inputs for search, insertion and deletion
  - The search performance of a balanced search tree is better (close to a perfect or complete tree)
     - We want to reduce the running time to O(log n) in the worst case
     - We want a binary search tree that is always balanced
## Objectives
* Definition
* Implementation
* Insertion algorithm
* Deletion algorithm
* Performance
## AVL Trees
* History
  - The name AVL comes from teh developers of this method, G. M. Adel'son-Vel'ski and E. M. Landis
  - The algorithm was proposed in 1962
* Definition 
  - An AVL tree is a binary search tree in which
    - the heights of the left and right subtrees of the root differ by at most 1
    - the left and right subtress are also AVL trees

* Other concepts
  - Each node has an additional balance factor with the following values:
    - Left higher: the height of the left subtree is greater than that of the right subtree (h(LST) > h(RST))
    - Equal: the height of the left subtree is equal to that of the right subtree (h(LST) = h(RST))
    - Right higher: the height of the left subtree is smaller than that of the right subtree (h(LST) < h(RST))
* Conventions in diagrams
  - / : A left-higher node
  - - : An equal_height node
  -  \ : A right_higher node
  -  // or \\: A left or right unbalanced node
* Based on the balance factor, do you have any suggestion about how to balance such a AVL tree?
  - You can also define balance factor of a node X as h (LST) â€“ h (RST)
  - think about insert and delete
    - Check and maintain the balance factor

* How to adjust the height and make it balanced?
  - Rotation!
    - The key: maintain BST and balance

    - 2-> right = 3; 4 -> left = 2
      - cur -> right = sub_right -> left; sub_right -> left = cur;
    - Sometimes double rotation may be needed
## AVL Tree Node
* An enumerated data type is used to record balance factors:
  - ```
    enum Balance_factor { left_higher, equal_height, right_higher };
    ```
* AVL nodes are structures derived by binary nodes with balance factors included
  - ```
    template<class Entry>
    struct Binary_node {
      // data members:
      Entry data;
      Binary_node<Entry> *left;
      Binary_node<Entry> *right;
      // constructors:
      Binary_node();
      Binary_node(const Entry &x);
    };
    ```
  - ```
    template<class Record>
    struct AVL_node: public Binary_node<Record>
    {
      // additional data member:
      Balance_factor balance;
      // constructors:
      AVL_node();
      AVL_node(const Record &x);
      // overridden virtual functions:
      void set_balance(Balance factor b);
      Balance_factor get_balance( ) const;
    };
    ```
  - The inherited left and right have type Binary_node*
     - A pointer to a base class can also pointer to a derived class
     - Make sure to insert only genuine AVL_nodes
* Discussion
  - The benefit of implementing AVL nodes with a derived structure is the reuse of all of the member functions of binary search trees
  - We shall use the AVL_node methods get_balance and set_balance to examine and adjust the balance factor of an AVL node.
    - Methods set_balance and get_balance may be invoked from pointers left and right
      - left->get_balance();
    - But left and right are pointers to Binary_node
      - A C++ compiler will reject a call such as left->get_balance( ), since there is no such methods in Binary_node
  - Solution: dummy virtual function added to the base class
* ```
  template <class Entry>
  struct Binary_node {
    // data members:
    Entry data;
    Binary_node<Entry> *left;
    Binary_node<Entry> *right;
    // constructors:
     Binary_node();
    Binary_node(const Entry &x);
    // virtual methods:
    virtual void set_balance(Balance_factor b);
    virtual Balance_factor get_balance() const;
  };
  ```
* About virtual function in C++
  - A derived class is handled using pointer or reference to the base class, a call to an overridden virtual function would invoke the behavior defined in the derived class
* Virtual methods (cont.)
  - The correct choice between the AVL version and the dummy version of the method is made at runtime
  - If set_balance( ) is called as a method of an AVL_node, then the AVL version will be used
  - If set_balance( ) is called as a method of a Binary_node then the dummy version will be used.
* The AVL tree class is derived from the binary search tree class
  - The insertion and deletion methods for binary search trees are overridden
    - Redefinition of base class function in its derived class with same signature, i.e., return type and parameters.
  - All other binary search tree methods are inherited without any changes
